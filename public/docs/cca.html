This is the account you nominated when you applied for the loan.<br/><br/></p><strong>Total Charge for Credit:</strong> £149.79<strong>APR:</strong> 29.9%<br/><strong>Interest rate:</strong> 29.9% per annum fixed <br/><p>Interest at the interest rate set out above is calculated on a daily basis on the balance of the account outstanding commencing on the day we release the loan. Interest will be debited to your account each month on the Repayment Date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding balance at the interest rate above, both before and after any court judgment.</p><br/><br/><strong>Total Amount Payable:</strong> £1149.79<strong>Duration of agreement:</strong> 12 months.<p><strong>Repayments: </strong> You agree to pay us 11 monthly instalments each in the sum of £95.82 and a final monthly instalment of £95.77 commencing on 04-11-2018 and continuing on the same day of each consecutive calendar month (the 'Repayment Date').  Where any Repayment Date is not a working day, it will be taken on the next working day.</p><br/><br/><p>The APR and the Total Amount Payable have been calculated on the assumption that the agreement will run for the duration above, and that each party will fulfil their obligations under it.<br/><br/></p><strong>RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</strong><p>You can withdraw from this agreement without giving a reason by logging into your account at https://LiveLend.co and closing your loan. You must log in and click on ‘Manage’, where you can withdraw from your loan within 14 days, starting the day after the agreement is made. Once you have done this [i.e. withdraw] you are obliged to repay your loan balance within 30 days, from the day after you give us notice. You can repay your loan online by entering your debit card details and clicking 'Pay and close your loan'. If you don't repay in this period, you are liable for the full balance of your loan, plus interest. Interest will be charged at the agreed daily amount of £0.72 from the date the loan was made, until you have paid us in full. </p><br/><br/><br/><strong>EARLY REPAYMENT AND OVERPAYMENTS</strong><p>You can repay your loan balance early, in part (referred to as an overpayment) or in full (referred to as early settlement, or closing your loan early). If you wish to do this, you should login to your account at https://LiveLend.co and click on ‘Manage’ and we’ll show you the impact on your loan or the amount that you have to repay to clear the outstanding balance in full. You won’t have to pay any additional fees or any early repayment charges. <br/>Because we charge interest on the outstanding balance, overpayments and closing your loan early will reduce the total interest you are charged. They won’t reduce the amount of your regular instalment unless you request it when you make the overpayment - in which case we’ll recalculate the amount of the remaining instalments so you repay the balance outstanding over the original loan term.</p><br/><br/><br/><strong>MISSING PAYMENTS</strong><p>Missing payments could have severe consequences. Interest will continue to be charged at the current interest rate on the amounts you failed to pay and will be added to the balance that attracts interest as described above - so you’ll end up paying more interest in total. We may pass information about your payment history to Credit Reference Agencies, which could impact your credit rating and make access to credit more difficult and expensive in the future. Failing to keep up with payments may also lead to us terminating your agreement and requiring you to pay the balance early. We may take legal proceedings against you and enforce any judgment we obtain, for example by getting a charging order against your home.  Further costs, including legal and court costs, may become due as part of this process for which you’ll be responsible. We don't charge default fees for missed payments but if we have to take legal action against you, we can recover our reasonable costs of doing so.</p><br/><br/><br/><strong>SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</strong><p>Chetwood Financial Limited is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority under the registration number 740551.

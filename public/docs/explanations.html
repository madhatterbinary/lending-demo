You can use it to help you assess whether the loan suits your needs and situation and you should read it carefully. At the end of the document we give you details of how to contact us, or additional sources, for more information.<br/><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>1. IS THIS PRODUCT SUITABLE FOR WHAT I WANT TO USE IT FOR?</strong></p><p>A personal loan from LiveLend, a trading name of Chetwood Financial Limited, is for a fixed amount, repayable over a fixed period of time, with interest charged at a fixed rate. Please consider any future changes to your current financial circumstances that may impact your ability to make the repayments. The duration or term of the agreement will be 12 months.  If you want a different repayment period or to make separate purchases over a period of time you may wish to consider whether an alternative product is more suitable for your requirements.</p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>2. HOW MUCH WILL THE LOAN COST ME?</strong></p><p>By entering into the agreement you’ll be required to pay 11 monthly instalments of £95.82 and a final instalment of £95.77. The total amount payable is of £1149.79 providing you make all repayments in full and on time. <br/>The interest rate of your agreement is fixed for the duration of the agreement and interest is calculated on a daily basis on the balance outstanding. Interest will continue to be charged on late and/or missed payments at the interest rate set out in the agreement. This means that interest will be added to the balance you owe us when payments are missed, and so interest will be charged on interest.</p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>It is important that you only enter into this agreement if you can comfortably afford the payments, and are not aware of any potential changes in your circumstances that could affect your ability to make the payments in the future.</strong></p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>3. WHAT OTHER FEATURES SHOULD I BE AWARE OF?</strong></p><p>Your loan must be managed online. This includes any updates to your personal information, and any servicing of your loan, for example  overpayments and early  settlement.  We  will send  you information relating  to the servicing  of  your loan by  sending the documents to the email address  you  give  us and uploading them to  your account  where  you can access them.</p><br/><p>All instalments must be paid by Direct Debit unless otherwise agreed by us.</p><br/><p>If you are using this loan to consolidate debt this may result in you paying a higher rate of interest and/or having to make repayments over a longer period and paying more in total.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>4. OTHER COSTS</strong></p><p>There may be other related costs under the loan agreement. While we don’t charge fees for missed payments you’ll need to pay more to cover the extra interest that will be incurred and as we set out in section 5 below if we need to take enforcement action against you we may look to you for our reasonable costs. <br/><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>5. MISSING PAYMENTS</strong></p><p>Missing payments could have severe consequences. Interest will continue to be charged at the current interest rate on the amounts you failed to pay and will itself be added to the balance that attracts interest as described above - so you’ll end up paying more interest in total. We may pass information about your payment history to Credit Reference Agencies, which could impact your credit rating and make access to credit more difficult and expensive in the future. Failing to keep up with payments may also lead to us terminating your agreement and requiring you to pay the balance early. We may take legal proceedings against you and enforce any judgment we obtain, for example by getting a charging order against your home. Further costs, including legal and court costs, may become due as part of this process for which you will be responsible. We don't charge default fees for missed  payments but if we have to take legal action against you, we can recover our reasonable costs of doing so.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>6. RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL </strong></p><p>You can withdraw from this agreement without giving a reason by logging into your account at https://LiveLend.co and closing your loan. You must log in and click on ‘Manage’ and request a quote within 14 days, starting the day after the agreement is made.  Once you have done this [i.e. withdraw] you are obliged to repay your loan balance within 30 days,  from  the  day  after  you  give  us  notice.  You  can  repay  your  loan  online  by  entering  your  debit  card  details  and clicking ‘Pay and close your loan’. If you don't repay in this period, you are liable for the full balance of your loan, plus interest. Interest will be charged at the agreed daily amount of £0.72 from the date the loan was made, until you have paid us in full.<br/><br/></p><p><strong>If there is anything you do not understand, or you have any questions about this information or the loan, or if you require any further information regarding this product please contact us at https://LiveLend.co.

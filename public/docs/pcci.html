Interest will continue to be charged at the current interest rate on the amounts you failed to pay and will itself be added to the balance that attracts interest as described above - so you’ll end up paying more interest in total. We may pass information about your payment history to Credit Reference Agencies, which could impact your credit rating and make access to credit more difficult and expensive in the future. Failing to keep up with payments may also lead to us terminating your agreement and requiring you to pay the balance early. We may take legal proceedings against you and enforce any judgment we obtain, for example by getting a charging order against your home. Further costs, including legal and court costs, may become due as part of this process for which you will be responsible. We don’t charge default fees for missed payments but if we have to take legal action against you, we can recover our reasonable costs of doing so. </p></td></tr></table><p><strong>4.

    <div>Once you&apos;ve done this we&apos;ll transfer your funds immediately so your money&apos;s in your account under four hours.</div>
    <h1 className='mb-4' style={{ fontSize: `${ 2.4 }rem` }}>&middot;</h1>
    <div><strong>Life has its up and downs. We won&apos;t charge you for that.</strong></div>
    <div>We won&apos;t charge you a fee. Ever. Not to open your loan, to service it or to close it early.</div>
    <div>We won&apos;t even charge you if you miss a loan repayment.</div>
    <h1 className='mb-4' style={{ fontSize: `${ 2.4 }rem` }}>&middot;</h1>
    <div><strong>Flexibility as standard</strong></div>
